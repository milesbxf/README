## Personal README ##

Hey! 👋 This is a guide on how best to interact with me. It's not a substitute
for getting to know me, but it should give some pointers as to how I can be
more helpful to you (and vice versa).


### Communication

❓ I sometimes struggle to get my ideas across clearly, or accidentally assume
someone has more context/knowledge than they do. If you don't understand 
something I say, please ask me to clarify.

⚠️ I can get very passionate when putting forward an idea I feel strongly
about, and occasionally this means I don't always consider other people's
opinions. Please tell me straight away if this is happening (see feedback
below).

### Hearing

👂 You may have noticed that I wear hearing aids - these do a phenomenal job
most of the time. I can struggle to hear people with higher pitched and/or
quieter voices. If I'm aware that you're speaking to me and I don't hear you,
I'll normally ask you to repeat yourself (sorry, this is probably quite
annoying by the third or fourth time 😬). If I'm not aware, it can look like 
I'm being rude or ignoring you 😢 this is definitely not the case!
Please get my attention and try again 🙂

Background noise also severely impacts my ability to hear - I prefer meetings
where one person is speaking at a time 🙏

### Feedback

Yes please! Sometimes to avoid being too self-conscious I make assumptions
about how I'm doing/how other people perceive me. I would like to know if
these assumptions are wrong.

##### How

Directly and in person/Slack DMs is my preference, but I will gratefully accept
feedback in whatever form it comes 🙃

##### When

Preferably as soon as possible after whatever prompted the feedback - this way
I have the most context on it.

##### Getting feedback from me

I aim to be direct, but kind with feedback - if this doesn't work for you, 
let me know. If you ask for feedback on a 1:1, you'll get much higher quality
and constructive feedback if you ask about something specific (e.g. "How
could I improve my code reviews?" rather than "Have you got any feedback for
me?")_

### Calendar/meetings

The best time to book something with me is generally in the morning (though 
check with me first if its before 10am) and at the end of the day._
I work on a [maker's schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)
where possible, which means I prefer having meetings in blocks. I might
occasionally ask if we can move a meeting or 1:1 to defrag my calendar a bit 💥

##### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

I'm happy to talk about anything in 1:1s!

### Other [first 1:1 questions](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

##### What makes you grumpy?
- Being in a meeting that I'm not providing value to and is not providing
  value to me
- Being [told to do something rather than asked to help with something](https://bobramseyseminars.com/2014/02/14/ask-vs-tell/)
- Being interrupted (if I'm guilty of this *tell me*)

##### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

I become much quieter (though to be fair this is indistinguishable from me
being Just Tired™️)
If I'm really grumpy I could be rude or blunt, though feed this back to me
later as I shouldn't be taking it out on others!

##### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

- Ask if I'm okay
- Get me a coffee/other drink (I will return the favour 💜 )

##### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Either is fine 👍

##### What’s your favourite baked good?

I'm a big pastry fan 🥐
