## Personal README ##

Hey! 👋 This is a guide on how best to work and interact with me. It's not a substitute for getting to know me, but it should give some pointers as to how I can be more helpful to you (and vice versa).

### Communication

🎧 I'm very easily distracted, and I highly value being able to focus and finish off a train of thought. This applies when I'm doing regular work, but also when I get back to my desk after a meeting (generally there's something I need to look up or a message I want to send). It can be frustrating if someone interrupts me in person in this time - I lose my train of thought as I switch context to speak with them, and have to pick it back up again. I'll generally ask people who do this to wait a few minutes while I finish what I'm doing.

💬 Instead, I'd much rather get @pinged on Slack. It seems silly sometimes - you could literally be sat at the desk next to me - but a Slack ping means I can finish my train of thought and switch context. I have Do Not Disturb on out of hours and sometimes in-hours if I'm interviewing or focused on something, so don't feel like you're going to distract me by sending a message.

### Hearing

👂 You may have noticed that I ~have bionic sensory augmentation~ wear hearing aids - these do a phenomenal job most of the time. I can struggle to hear people with higher pitched and/or quieter voices. My brain has to work extra hard to work out what they're saying, which is tiring. If I'm aware that you're speaking to me and I don't hear you, I'll normally ask you to repeat yourself (sorry, this is probably quite annoying by the third or fourth time 😬). If I'm not aware, it can look like I'm being rude or ignoring you 😢 this is definitely not the case! Please get my attention and try again 🙂

Background noise also severely impacts my ability to hear - I prefer meetings where one person is speaking at a time 🙏
When I'm tired, my hearing suffers (presumably as my brain doesn't have the capacity to keep up), do take this into account.

### Feedback

Yes please! Sometimes to avoid being too self-conscious I make assumptions about how I'm doing/how other people perceive me. I would like to know if these assumptions are wrong.

##### How

I'm happy to receive feedback directly and in person/Slack DMs, but if you feel more comfortable going down a different route, please go for it 🙏

##### When

Preferably as soon as possible after whatever prompted the feedback - this way I have the most context on it. There's generally not a bad time for giving me feedback (unless it's months afterwards)

##### Getting feedback from me

I aim to be direct, but kind with feedback - if this doesn't work for you, let me know. If you ask for feedback on a 1:1, you'll get much higher quality and constructive feedback if you ask about something specific (e.g. "How could I improve my code reviews?" rather than "Have you got any feedback for me?")_

### Calendar/meetings

The best time to book something with me is generally in the morning (though check with me first if its before 10am) and at the end of the day.

##### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

I will happily chat about anything in 1:1s, but I especially love talking about organisational and team dynamics, or the frustrations people feel in their daily work.

### Other [first 1:1 questions](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

##### What makes you grumpy?
- Being in a meeting that I'm not providing value to and is not providing value to me
- Being [told to do something rather than asked to help with something](https://bobramseyseminars.com/2014/02/14/ask-vs-tell/)
- Being interrupted (if I'm guilty of this *tell me*)

##### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

I become much quieter (though to be fair this is indistinguishable from me being Just Tired™️)
If I'm really grumpy I could be rude or blunt, though feed this back to me later as I shouldn't be taking it out on others!

##### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

- Ask if I'm okay
- Get me a coffee/other drink (I will return the favour 💜 )

##### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Either is fine 👍

##### What’s your favourite baked good?

I'm a big pastry fan 🥐
